        <!-- Section 1: Where It Started -->
        <section class="about-section" tabindex="0">
            <span class="section-label">The Beginning</span>
            <h2>Where It Started</h2>
            
            <p>I didn't grow up thinking I'd end up in tech. My first love was art — the kind you make with your hands, covered in paint, standing in front of a canvas for hours. At Lansing Community College, I spent two years deep in fine art, painting and sculpting, learning to see the world in shapes, shadows, and negative space.</p>
            
            <p>But here's the thing about being an artist: you start to see design everywhere. In the way a webpage loads. In the flow of an app. In the tiny frustrations of buttons that don't work the way they should. That curiosity pulled me toward information science, first at MSU, and now at the University of Michigan, where I'm finishing my Master's.</p>
            
            <p>The transition wasn't a departure — it was an expansion. I traded brushes for code, but the instincts stayed the same. I still think about composition, contrast, and rhythm. I still want everything I make to feel intentional.</p>

        <!-- Section 2: How I Create -->
        <section class="about-section" tabindex="0">
            <span class="section-label">Creative Philosophy</span>
            <h2>How I Create</h2>
            
            <p>My work is punchy. It's bold. It's clean with a modern edge, but there's always something a little vintage underneath — like a jazz sample in a hip-hop beat. I like to test boundaries, to try things that feel a little risky, to push past the obvious solution and see what else is possible.</p>
            
            <p>I think that comes from music. When you grow up listening across decades — jazz from the 40s, rock from the 70s, grunge from the 90s, R&B from now — you learn that the best work borrows from everywhere. You learn that "new" doesn't mean "from scratch." It means remixing what came before into something fresh.</p>
            
            <p>That's how I approach every project. I bring the classics with me, but I'm not afraid to experiment. Fun colors. Unexpected layouts. A little personality where you don't expect it. The goal is always the same: make something usable, make it beautiful, make it feel like it was made by a human who actually cared.</p>

        <!-- Section 3: The Soundtrack Underneath -->
        <section class="about-section" tabindex="0">
            <span class="section-label">The Music Connection</span>
            <h2>The Soundtrack Underneath</h2>
            
            <p>Music has been my constant. Through every major life transition — moving cities, switching majors, starting over — there's been a playlist. Not background noise, but a companion. A way to process. A way to feel understood when I couldn't find the words myself.</p>
            
            <p>I started with the classics because that's what I heard growing up. Ella Fitzgerald's voice felt like velvet. Frankie Valli made heartbreak sound beautiful. Dave Brubeck's "Take Five" taught me that the best art breaks the rules on purpose.</p>
            
            <p>Then came the rock phase — Fleetwood Mac, Heart, Led Zeppelin. Music with weight. Music that demanded you pay attention. I learned about dynamics, about building tension and releasing it, about the power of a perfectly placed pause.</p>
            
            <p>The 90s are where I planted roots. Matchbox 20, Green Day, The Pixies — this is still my home genre, the one I return to when I need to feel grounded. There's something about that era's honesty, its rawness, that never gets old. I don't think I'll ever outgrow it.</p>
            
            <p>Now I listen to everything. Pop. R&B. Rap. Indie. Laufey and Lizzy McAlpine sit next to Kendrick Lamar and SZA in my rotation. My playlists are chaotic in the best way — a reflection of how I actually experience the world. Why limit yourself to one thing when you can have it all?</p>

            <h2>Currently</h2>
            
            <p>Right now, I'm finishing my MS in Information at the University of Michigan, still figuring out how to merge art and tech in ways that feel meaningful. I work part-time, I build things, I listen to too much music, and I try to bring a little more color into everything I touch.</p>
            
            <p>This site is part journal, part portfolio, part experiment. It's a place to document the evolution — of my taste, my work, and myself. Thanks for being here.</p>
